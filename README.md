### Housing 
As we see nationwide increases in mortgage rates and rental prices, I was interested to explore the current state of homelessness by zip code. A few questions I am looking to answer include:

- Which areas experience the greatest homelessness rate in the US?*
- Do areas with high homelessless experience higher rental prices than the national rental price average?*

- PIT and HIC Data for 2021: https://www.hudexchange.info/resource/3031/pit-and-hic-data-since-2007/
- Zillow Observed Rent Index (ZORI): https://www.zillow.com/research/data/

*With population size of state/zipcode in mind.
